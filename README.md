## Overview

This project focuses on classifying brain tumors into different categories using a dataset of brain MRI scans. The objective is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between different types of tumors based on image features.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` or `keras` (for deep learning models)
- `opencv-python` (for image processing)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow opencv-python 
```

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of MRI scans of brain tumors. You can download the dataset from [dataset source link if available](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri) and place it in the appropriate directory. Ensure that the images are organized according to their respective categories.

## Notebook Structure

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: This section involves loading the dataset, exploring the data, and visualizing sample images.
2. **Preprocessing**: Includes image resizing, normalization, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Building**: Implements and trains machine learning or deep learning models for tumor classification.
4. **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Results**: Presents the results and discusses the effectiveness of the model.

## Usage

To run the notebook, open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Execute each cell sequentially to follow the workflow and observe the results. Make sure you have the dataset available in the expected directory.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bilal-ahmad8/Brain-Tumor-Classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Brain-Tumor-Classification
   ```

3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Brain-Tumor-Classification.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells.

## Results

The notebook includes a detailed analysis of the model's performance, including confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy metrics. The results show the model's ability to classify brain tumors accurately.
